Hybrid Impulse Response Model (HRIM)
======

*****

This is the repository for the hybrid impulse response model **HIRM**. HIRM leverages the strengths of process-based Simple Climate Models (SCMs) by using SCM derived outputs as inputs in an idealized impulse response model. This hybrid approach, combining processed based calculations in an idealized SCM framework structure allows HIRM to capture the crucial nonlinear climate dynamics in a computationally efficient, easy to modify modeling framework.

While the code is documented with [Doxygen](http://doxygen.org)-style comments. The primary link to HIRM model documation is the [online manual](TODO) and a formal documenation paper in progress (Dorherim et al. submitted to Earth Space Science). Please refer to package vignettes for examples of using HIRM.

Hybrid Impulse Response Model (HRIM)
======

*****

This is the repository for the hybrid impulse response model **HIRM**. HIRM leverages the strengths of process-based Simple Climate Models (SCMs) by using SCM derived outputs as inputs in an idealized impulse response model. This hybrid approach, combining processed based calculations in an idealized SCM framework structure allows HIRM to capture the crucial nonlinear climate dynamics in a computationally efficient, easy to modify modeling framework.

The HIRM R code is documented with [Doxygen-style](http://doxygen.org) comments, with function documentation and an example vignette available along with a formal documentation paper (Dorherim et al. submitted to Earth Space Science). The [online manual](https://jgcri.github.io/HIRM/) contains links to the HIRM [function documentation](https://jgcri.github.io/HIRM/reference/index.html)  a [vignette](https://jgcri.github.io/HIRM/articles/HIRM-basics.html) that demonstrates how to use HIRM to replicate hectorâ€™s RCP4.5 scenario.
